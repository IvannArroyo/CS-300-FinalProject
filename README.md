The ultimate goal of each project was to create an efficient system for managing course information. The systems design included storing, retrieving, and managing all course information along with their designated prerequisites. The initial main challenge was finding a data structure that could not only handle frequent lookups, but that could also maintain its performance as the dataset spontaneously grew. I began by exploring each data structure including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. Each data structure had its own strengths as vectors were easy to implement, hash tables provided fast search and insertion, and BSTs were useful for ordered retrieval. I ultimately decided to use hash tables due to their speed and efficiency in managing larger data sets. Some of the challenges I faced included managing collisions in the hash table and ensuring the dataset file was in the correct location within the project files. I was able to overcome these challenges by refining the hash table's collision management and adding the dataset file to each debug folder created. Additionally, I tested the program over and over in order to ensure it ran properly and its output was what I desired. This project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs as it demonstrated the importance of choosing the correct data structure based on the system's needs. It truly showed me how important data organization and retrieval are to system performance, and taught me to balance speed, memory usage, and ease of implementation. Additionally, this project taught me the importance of writing clean, organized, modular code. By separating each task into smaller functions, I was able to make the program easier to maintain and update. Working with these different data structures also helped me write flexible code that has the capability to adapt.
